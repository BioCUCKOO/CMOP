The three novel algorithms were developed for multi-omic integration and analysis in ICC, including random dropout-based subtyping (RDS) for an improved molecular subtyping, prioritization of actionable kinases (pAKin) for prioritization of potentially actionable kinases, and prioritization of master TFs (pMaT) for prediction of key TFs.
